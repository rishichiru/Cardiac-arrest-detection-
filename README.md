Cardiac arrest detection can be enhanced using Random Forest (RF) with ECG data in CSV format and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with image processing. The ECG data, stored in CSV format, contains numerical values representing heart activity, such as heart rate variability and waveform features. The Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method, can analyze this data to classify heart rhythms and detect abnormalities indicating cardiac arrest. Meanwhile, SVM (Support Vector Machine) is well-suited for image classification tasks, making it effective in analyzing visual signs like chest movement and facial color changes. By applying SVM to thermal images or video frames, the system can identify crucial indicators such as cyanosis or lack of respiratory motion. Combining RF for ECG classification and SVM for image analysis enhances detection accuracy, making it useful for real-time monitoring in healthcare and wearable medical devices. However, challenges such as ECG signal noise, image quality, and computational complexity must be addressed for an efficient and reliable detection system.
